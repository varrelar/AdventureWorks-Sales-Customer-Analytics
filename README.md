## 📌 Project Objectives

- Build a unified analytical dataset from multiple fact and dimension tables  
- Assess data quality and perform necessary cleaning  
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) across customers, products, time, and geography  
- Evaluate sales trends and category performance  
- Generate actionable business insights and recommendations

## 🗂️ Dataset Description

Seven relational tables are used:

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **InternetSales** | Transaction-level sales data |
| **Customer** | Demographics and personal information |
| **Product** | Product-level metadata |
| **ProductCategory** | Category hierarchy and attributes |
| **Geography** | City, state, and country information |
| **SalesTerritory** | Regional territory groupings |
| **Employee** | Sales personnel details |

The tables follow a **star schema**, where the InternetSales fact table connects to key dimensions.

## 🔧 Key Steps Performed

### **1. Data Quality Assessment**
- Missing values detected on Product and Customer attributes  
- No missing values in InternetSales  
- Minor imputations applied where appropriate  

### **2. Cleaning & Feature Engineering**
- Standardized column names and data types  
- Derived features:
  - `total_ordervalue`
  - `customer_age`
- Imputed subcategory and color fields  
- Merged all tables into one analytical dataset  

### **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Univariate:** sales distribution, customer age, profit, delivery metrics  
- **Categorical:** product categories, territories, colors  
- **Time-series:** yearly and quarterly performance trends  
- **Bivariate:** sales vs age, category vs profit, region vs sales

## 📊 Key Insights

### **1. Sales peaked sharply in 2020**
A significant performance spike appears in 2020 before declining in 2021.

### **2. Revenue is highly concentrated**
A small number of high-value transactions dominate total revenue.

### **3. Middle-aged customers drive the business**
Consumers aged **35–55** consistently generate the highest sales.

### **4. Product performance is uneven**
Some categories show strong sales but low margins, revealing optimization opportunities.

### **5. Operational consistency**
DeliveryDays is fixed at 7 for all records—indicating stable SLA compliance.
